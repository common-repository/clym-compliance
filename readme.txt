== Consent management ==
- **Business friendly approach:** Using Clym helps your attorneys sleep better at night,but what about your marketing team?

That’s why at Clym we believe in striking the right balance between legal compliance and marketing optimization. Our platform allows the maximum amount of data to be collected in accordance with the regulation imposed by your website’s visitors.
- **A user interface and experience customers expect:** You put a lot of money into the look and feel of your website, and we’re not here to intrude. Our customizable platform provides you with the ability to have the look and feel you want: widget placement, color scheme and branding for your company can reduce the friction your website visitors experience when browsing your website.
- **Global Coverage:** New regulations are introduced into law on a regular basis and existing regulations are frequently amended. Clym's platform configures the location-specific settings needed to ensure you are set up for success.

We have default settings for all major data privacy laws around the globe, and our clean, crisp user interface makes it easy to customize how you want your website to look and feel. And if you run into questions, our support team is available around the clock to assist.
- **Audit trail:** For every visit to your website a record of given consent is registered through our tool, which helps you have an audit-ready trail of data. This way you are always prepared to show when, where, why, what and how consent was obtained.

== Data subjects’ requests ==
- **Collect and store DSARs:**  Clym’s Privacy Widget not only collects your website visitors’ consent, it also allows your visitors to submit DSARs
- **Verify submitted requests:** When a DSAR is submitted through Clym’s Privacy Widget, an email is sent to the individual that made the request in order for them to validate the request through the verification link within that email. This is a precaution against spam requests.
- **Notifications:** You can view all requests submitted by your customers in real time by logging into your account. In addition to viewing DSARs within your admin console, you can also assign one or more email addresses to receive a notification any time a new request has been verified by the user, keeping you up to date with everything.
- **Efficient reply system:**  Clym makes it easy for you to timely respond to DSARs through your admin console so that all responses and correspondence are time-stamped and tied directly to the request. Also, to save time for you and your team, Clym provides default reply templates for various types of requests, that can be customized as needed, based on your preferences and language.

== Policies and other legal documents ==
- **Manage Terms, Policies, Agreements, and Procedures:** Clym helps you simplify and streamline policy management, adaptable by jurisdiction. Create, update, and communicate policies at any time, in a transparent way, letting users know what the latest version is and when it was updated. Manage public or private agreements and procedures.
- **Embed and share policies:**  All policies, agreements and procedures managed through Clym can be easily included in your domain or shared with partners by using embed codes and unique document URLs. Whenever a new document version is created, we automatically sync and update it everywhere.

- This feature gives you comfort in knowing you are up-to-date with the categorization and   classification   of   your   scripts   and   cookies.   It   scans   every   visited   page, **automatically** without affecting the **website’s performance**.

== Geofencing ==
- Clym uses IP addresses of your website visitors to determine where they are and automatically   show   them   the   legal   content   relevant   to   their   country   or   region: location-specific  scripts,   cookies,   and   legal   documents,   content   language   set **automatically**, and allow users to **toggle between** languages and jurisdictions.
- Clym’s robust settings allow you to adhere to all location-specific privacy regulations by using Clym’s **database of regions and countries** with their corresponding data privacy laws, add and  **customize jurisdictions**  for less common locations, and **adjust** the widget, cookie settings, documents, and other features of each jurisdiction.

== Insights ==
